## Project Overview

The ZingoShop backend plays a crucial role in managing the core e-commerce logic, data, and interactions for the entire platform. It provides a secure and efficient system for handling:

- User authentication and management.
- Product catalog and inventory.
- Shopping cart operations.
- Order processing and tracking.
- Address management.
- Coupon codes and discounts.
- Push notifications for order updates and promotions.
- Admin functionalities for managing the platform.
- Delivery personnel functionalities for order fulfillment.

## Features

- **User Management:** The backend securely handles user registration, login, account activation via email verification, and password reset with email verification. 
- **Product Management:** Provides robust endpoints for managing the product catalog, including creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting products and categories. 
- **Order Management:**  Enables efficient order processing, from creation and status updates to tracking, history management, and user ratings.
- **Address Management:**  Allows users to store, update, and delete their shipping addresses for accurate and convenient deliveries.
- **Cart Management:** Provides the functionality for users to add and manage items in their shopping carts, including updating quantities and removing items.
- **Coupon Management:** Validates coupon codes, applies discounts to orders, and manages coupon usage limits.
- **Notification Management:**  Utilizes Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) to send real-time push notifications to users, keeping them informed about order updates, promotions, and other relevant events. 
- **Admin Functionality:** The backend offers a secure set of endpoints for admin actions, including product and category management, order processing and fulfillment, and configuration of app-wide settings.
- **Delivery Functionality:** Provides dedicated endpoints for delivery personnel to access assigned orders, update delivery statuses, and utilize real-time tracking to ensure efficient order delivery.

## Architecture

The ZingoShop backend follows a structured approach to ensure code clarity, maintainability, and scalability. 

- **RESTful API:** The API design adheres to REST (Representational State Transfer) principles, providing a standardized and consistent way for the frontend applications to interact with the backend. 
- **Modularity:** The codebase is organized into logical modules based on features and functionalities. This modularity promotes code reusability and simplifies maintenance.
- **Data Handling:**  The backend utilizes a MySQL database to store and manage data efficiently. Database interactions are handled through well-defined queries and procedures, ensuring data integrity and security.

## Technologies Used

- **PHP:** The core server-side programming language for processing API requests, handling business logic, and managing data interactions. 
- **MySQL:** The relational database management system used for storing and managing data related to products, users, orders, and other e-commerce entities. 
- **Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM):** Integrated for sending real-time push notifications to users. 

## API Documentation

The ZingoShop backend exposes a comprehensive RESTful API, providing a well-defined interface for the frontend applications to interact with the core functionalities. 

This documentation outlines the RESTful API endpoints for the ZingoShop backend. The API facilitates communication between the Flutter frontend applications (user, admin, and delivery) and the PHP/MySQL backend.

**Base URL:** [Your Base URL] (e.g., `http://yourdomain.com/ecommerce_from_host/`)

**Data Format:** JSON

**Authentication:** 
- Some endpoints may require authentication using API keys or tokens.
- You can implement a basic authentication mechanism using headers (e.g., `Authorization: Basic base64_encoded(username:password)`).

**Error Handling:** 
- The API will return a JSON response with a `status` field indicating "success" or "failure."
- In case of errors, a `message` field will provide details about the error.
